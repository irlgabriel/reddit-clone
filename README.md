### - I am building this reddit clone with node, express, mongo and react for LEARNING purposes!

#### - current [deployment](https://shrouded-sierra-00610.herokuapp.com)

### TO-DO/FIX

#### - Add comments(done) and replies (and replies to replies? - how to nest those and how much?)

#### - [Very important] - ADD Flash messages! (maybe add a msg key in the response body and use a state in main component to render it when there's a message sent back?)

#### - Add a feature to subscribe/unsubscribe to subreddits
