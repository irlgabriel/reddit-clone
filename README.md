### - I am building this reddit clone with node, express, mongo and react for LEARNING purposes!

#### - current [deployment](https://shrouded-sierra-00610.herokuapp.com)

### TO-DO/FIX

#### - FIX Logic for user's karma or think of a better way to handle it. (i.e. maybe getting all user's posts and comments then adding their upvotes and subtracting downvotes)

#### - Set up HOME/ALL/POPULAR pages like in the real reddit app

#### - Error when creating subreddit but it still gets created

#### - Figure out Home/All filtering
