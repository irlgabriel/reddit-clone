### - I am building this reddit clone with node, express, mongo and react for LEARNING purposes!

#### - current [deployment](https://shrouded-sierra-00610.herokuapp.com)

## Features
### - Persisting authentication system with mongo-connect and passportjs
### - Upvotes, Downvotes for post/comments/replies
### - CRUD routes for post/comments/subreddits/users
### - Five level nesting replies!
### - Subreddit subscription!
### - Dynamic pages for home/all/subreddit/profile with react router.
### - Search subreddits in the top searchbar!
### - Flash messages


## Known bugs
### - Sorting does not work on home page
### - No flash messages for validation failure from the server side(mongodb validations) and for user authentication failure.
### - Subreddit subscription status doesn't update across all pages when you update it and then jump in another page, until you refresh it.
