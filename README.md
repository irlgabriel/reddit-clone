### - I am building this reddit clone with node, express, mongo and react for LEARNING purposes!

#### - current [deployment](https://shrouded-sierra-00610.herokuapp.com)

### TO-DO/FIX

#### - [Very important] - ADD Flash messages! (maybe add a msg key in the response body and use a state in main component to render it when there's a message sent back?)

#### - FIX Logic for user's karma or think of a better way to handle it. (i.e. maybe getting all user's posts and comments then adding their upvotes and subtracting downvotes)

#### - Set up HOME/ALL/POPULAR pages like in the real reddit app
