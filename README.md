### - I am building this reddit clone with node, express, mongo and react for LEARNING purposes!

#### - current [deployment](https://shrouded-sierra-00610.herokuapp.com)

### TO-DO/FIX

#### - Need to figure delete routes for Posts and Subreddits and more specifically how to make sure only the owner of the post/subreddit can delete their posts.

#### - Add comments and replies (and replies to replies? - how to nest those and how much?)

#### - Small problem with deployment(!!!) - <code>Unhandled Promise Rejection: SyntaxError: The string did not match the expected pattern</code> - A problem with routes. I remember getting this error locally when a request was reaching a down server.
